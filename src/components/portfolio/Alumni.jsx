          <p className="mb-4">
            The Alumni App aims to facilitate mentorship and career guidance by allowing students to reach out to alumni for professional assistance. Alumni can select the requests they want to engage with, helping students grow their professional network and improve their career readiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            The app is currently hosted for free on Render, with a PostgreSQL database set up for managing user data and interactions. Future updates will focus on improving the user interface (UI), enhancing mobile responsiveness, and expanding the app’s functionality to improve usability for both students and alumni.
